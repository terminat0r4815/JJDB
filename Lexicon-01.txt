Okay, I understand! This will be very helpful for maintaining clarity and focus as our project evolves.

**1. My Project Name:**

For this "MTG AI Deck Builder" project, you can refer to me as **"Lexicon"**.
The name is inspired by the idea of a structured vocabulary or a system of knowledge, which seems fitting for a project involving AI, language, and the detailed rules and card base of Magic: The Gathering, especially as we're building a system that needs to understand and translate concepts (like playstyles) into structured queries (like for Scryfall).

**2. "Log Progress!" Protocol:**

When you prompt me with "Log Progress!", I will provide a structured update designed to be a comprehensive callback point. It will include the following sections:

```
--- MTG AI Deck Builder: Project Log ---
Assistant Name: Lexicon
Date/Time: [I will state that I cannot provide real-time date/time, but will mark the log]

I. Project Overview:
    - A brief (1-2 sentence) reminder of the main project goal (e.g., "To create a web interface that guides users to generate a 100-card MTG Commander decklist with themed names, using AI for Scryfall query generation and creative theming.").

II. Current Phase Focus:
    - A description of the primary phase or major component we are currently working on (e.g., "Phase 1: Scryfall Card List Generation", "Phase 2: AI-Powered Theming of Fetched Cards", "Phase 3: UI Display and Finalization").

III. Progress Since Last Log / Key Accomplishments:
    - A summary of significant milestones achieved or problems solved since the last "Log Progress!" entry (or from the beginning if it's the first).
    - Example: "Successfully implemented the Node.js proxy server to handle Scryfall API calls, resolving CORS issues. The AI (gpt-4o) is now generating Scryfall queries based on user theme/playstyle, and cards are being fetched."

IV. Detailed Steps Taken & Problem Solving:
    - A more granular list of actions performed. This will include:
        - User prompts/requests.
        - My responses and explanations.
        - Key code changes made to specific files (e.g., `script.js`, `server.js`, `index.html`), including brief descriptions of the changes and their purpose. I will mention if tool calls were made to apply these.
        - Errors encountered (e.g., API errors, CORS, code bugs).
        - Debugging steps taken and solutions implemented.
        - Refinements made to prompts or tool definitions for AI interaction.

V. Current Code State (Key Snippets or File Status if Relevant):
    - If particularly relevant to the log point, I might briefly mention the status of key functions or include a very short, critical snippet that was just worked on. (I will avoid large code dumps here).

VI. Outstanding Issues or Blockers:
    - Any known problems that are currently preventing progress or need to be addressed next.

VII. Next Immediate Steps:
    - The 2-3 concrete actions we are about to undertake or that I am waiting on the user for.
    - Example: "1. Test the latest changes to `server.js` to confirm Scryfall queries are successful via the proxy. 2. If successful, proceed to implement Phase 2: sending the fetched card list to OpenAI for theming."

Okay, understood! I will generate the progress log now.

Regarding saving the file: As Lexicon, an AI assistant operating within this environment, I can generate the text for the log, but **I don't have the capability to directly save files to your local computer's folder (like "MTG AI Builder") with a timestamped name.**

You will need to **copy the log content I provide below and then paste it into a new text file** on your system. You can then name that file with a timestamp yourself (e.g., `MTG_AI_Builder_Log_YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM.txt`).

Here is your project log:

--- MTG AI Deck Builder: Project Log ---
Assistant Name: Lexicon
Date/Time: [Lexicon cannot generate real-time timestamps; please note the current date/time manually when saving this log.]

I. Project Overview:
    - To create a web interface that guides users to generate a 100-card MTG Commander decklist. This involves fetching real MTG cards via the Scryfall API based on AI-generated queries (derived from user's theme and playstyle) and then using AI again to apply themed names and reasoning to these cards.

II. Current Phase Focus:
    - Phase 1: Scryfall Card List Generation via AI-assisted query building and a backend proxy for API calls. Specifically, we are debugging the interaction between the client-side JavaScript (`script.js`), the Node.js proxy server (`server.js`), and the Scryfall API.

III. Progress Since Last Log / Key Accomplishments:
    - Established a Node.js Express server (`server.js`) to act as a proxy for Scryfall API calls, aiming to resolve CORS and direct client-side API call issues.
    - Successfully installed Node.js dependencies (`express`, `axios`) after resolving PowerShell execution policy issues.
    - Resolved `MODULE_NOT_FOUND` errors for `server.js` by ensuring the file was created and the `node server.js` command was run from the correct project directory.
    - Confirmed basic Node.js server functionality with a "smoke test" server.
    - Identified and addressed an issue where the full Express server (`server.js`) was not starting, likely due to issues with code or missing dependencies, which was then resolved.
    - Refined the OpenAI API prompt (`PHASE_1_SYSTEM_PROMPT` and `SCRYFALL_TOOL_DEFINITION` in `script.js`) multiple times to improve the AI's ability to generate valid and effective Scryfall query strings, including guidance on using Oracle text, functional tags (`otag:`), and art tags (`arttag:`), and how to translate playstyle concepts.
    - Corrected an issue in `server.js` related to double URL encoding of the Scryfall query string. The fix involves letting `axios` handle the final encoding of the query parameter passed to the Scryfall API.
    - Confirmed the integrated PowerShell terminal in Cursor is now recognizing `node` commands after a Cursor restart.

IV. Detailed Steps Taken & Problem Solving:
    1.  **User Goal:** Create a website to generate themed MTG Commander decks.
    2.  **Initial Setup:** Created `index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`, `README.md`, `requirements.txt`.
    3.  **User Input:** Added form to `index.html` for "theme" and "playstyle". `script.js` captures these.
    4.  **OpenAI API for Theming (Initial attempt, direct from client):**
        *   Added `OPENAI_API_KEY` placeholder and `PRECURSOR_PROMPT` to `script.js`.
        *   Implemented `getAICompletions` to call OpenAI.
        *   Debugged API key not being recognized (save file, browser cache issues). User confirmed key was added.
    5.  **Issue: AI Hallucinating Cards:** GPT was inventing card names.
    6.  **Decision: Integrate Scryfall API:** To use real card data.
    7.  **Strategy: Two-Phase AI Interaction:**
        *   Phase 1: AI generates Scryfall query.
        *   Phase 2: AI themes cards fetched by that query.
    8.  **Implemented Phase 1 (AI Query Generation - `script.js`):**
        *   Defined `SCRYFALL_TOOL_DEFINITION` and `PHASE_1_SYSTEM_PROMPT`.
        *   Modified `getAIScryfallQuery` (renamed from `getAICompletions`) to use tools and expect a query string.
        *   Added `fetchCardsFromScryfall` to call Scryfall API directly from `script.js`.
    9.  **Problem: Scryfall 404 Errors (Bad AI Queries):**
        *   AI included user's thematic character names (e.g., "Gustave") directly in `o:` searches.
        *   AI used literal phrases like `o:"activated ability"`.
        *   **Solution:** Iteratively refined `SCRYFALL_TOOL_DEFINITION` and `PHASE_1_SYSTEM_PROMPT` to guide AI better on query construction, including examples, "BAD vs. GOOD" query parts, and suggesting `otag:` and `arttag:`.
    10. **Problem: CORS Errors / Scryfall 503 Errors:** Direct client-side calls to Scryfall from `script.js` (even from `localhost` via Live Server) were blocked.
        *   **Solution Attempted:** Advised using a local development server (VS Code Live Server, Python http.server).
        *   **Persistent Issue:** CORS/503 errors continued.
        *   **Solution Implemented: Node.js Backend Proxy:**
            *   Provided code for `server.js` using Express and Axios.
            *   Instructed user on `npm init -y`, `npm install express axios`.
            *   Modified `fetchCardsFromScryfall` in `script.js` to call `/scryfall-proxy`.
    11. **Problem: PowerShell Execution Policy:** User couldn't run `npm` due to script execution being disabled.
        *   **Solution:** Advised `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser`. User confirmed this worked.
    12. **Problem: `server.js` Module Not Found:** Node.js couldn't find `server.js`.
        *   **Solution:** Guided user to ensure `server.js` was created in the correct directory and `node server.js` was run from that directory. User then asked how to create the file.
        *   **Solution:** Provided instructions to create `server.js` and paste in the server code.
    13. **Problem: `server.js` Not Printing Startup Messages / Site Unreachable:**
        *   **Solution:** Used a "smoke test" with a minimal HTTP server in `server.js` to confirm Node.js environment was working. This test was successful.
        *   **Conclusion:** The issue was in the more complex Express server code or its dependencies.
        *   **Resolution:** User confirmed the full server (`server.js`) started working after ensuring dependencies were installed and code was correct.
    14. **Problem: Cursor Integrated Terminal Not Recognizing `node`:**
        *   **Solution:** Advised restarting Cursor to refresh its environment PATH. User confirmed this worked.
    15. **Problem: Scryfall 400 Error via Proxy ("You didn’t enter anything to search for"):**
        *   Identified likely double URL encoding: `script.js` encoded the query for the proxy, and `server.js` was (incorrectly) encoding it again before sending to `axios`.
        *   **Solution:** Modified `server.js` to remove the `encodeURIComponent` call and instead pass the raw query string (received from the client) to `axios` using the `params: { q: query }` option, letting `axios` handle the final, correct encoding.

V. Current Code State (Key Snippets or File Status if Relevant):
    - `script.js`: Contains logic for Phase 1 (OpenAI call for Scryfall query, then calls `/scryfall-proxy`) and initial setup for Phase 2 (OpenAI call for theming cards, function `getAIThemedDeck` is defined and called, raw output displayed). The `SCRYFALL_TOOL_DEFINITION` and `PHASE_1_SYSTEM_PROMPT` are heavily refined.
    - `server.js`: Contains the Node.js Express proxy server. The `/scryfall-proxy` route has been updated to correctly handle query parameter encoding for `axios`.
    - `index.html`: Basic structure with input form and results area.
    - `style.css`: Basic styling.

VI. Outstanding Issues or Blockers:
    - None immediately apparent; the last known blocker (Scryfall 400 error "didn't enter anything to search for") should be resolved by the latest change to `server.js`.

VII. Next Immediate Steps:
    1.  **Test the application with the corrected `server.js` (the one that avoids double URL encoding for the Scryfall query).**
        *   User needs to:
            *   Ensure the latest `server.js` code (where `encodeURIComponent` was removed and `axios` `params` option is used) is saved.
            *   Stop any old `node server.js` process (Ctrl+C).
            *   Restart `node server.js`.
            *   Access `http://localhost:3000/index.html` and submit a theme/playstyle.
        *   **Expected Outcome:** The Scryfall query should now be successful, and a list of cards should be fetched and displayed (raw data for now) without the "You didn’t enter anything to search for" error. The subsequent Phase 2 call to `getAIThemedDeck` should also trigger and attempt to theme these cards.
    2.  If Scryfall fetching is successful, observe the raw output from the Phase 2 theming call (`getAIThemedDeck`).
    3.  Proceed to parse the Phase 2 AI response (themed card data) and implement logic to add basic lands.
    4.  Develop the UI to display the full, themed 100-card deck list.

--- End of Log ---

Please proceed with testing the application after ensuring `server.js` has the latest fix and restarting the Node server! Let me know the results.
